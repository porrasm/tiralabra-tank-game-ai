## Week 5 Report

### Mo 19.8.2019

I added a release for the previous week which I forgot.

### Th 22.8.2019

I added peer review instructions in case the reviewer has Unity.

### Fr 23.8.2019

Today I added the initial [design document](https://github.com/porrasm/tiralabra-tank-game-ai/tree/master/Documentation/design-document.md). I spent extra time measuring the pathfinding performances and comparing them because I thought it was interesting.

## Notes

At the beginning of the week I was pretty lazy with this project.
