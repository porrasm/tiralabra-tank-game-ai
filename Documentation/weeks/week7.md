# Week 7 report

This week I spent doing only necessary bug fixes and documentation as well as preparing a while for the demo.

## Final thoughts

I really enjoyed working on the project at the beginning but as the project bloated into a big mess I lost some motivation for it because developing it got harder and harder. I had no prior knowledge of AI (or game bots) so the project turned out a bit too hard for my skill sets.

However, I'm happy that I chose this as my project. I did many things wrong and I hope I learned from them. I feel that if I were to implement another game bot (or re-do this one) it would turn out far better.
